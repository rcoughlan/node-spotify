# A node-cli app to interact with Spotify 

Get your most recent tracks, your top tracks and your top artists listened to. 

## Auth Token

To run this app you will need to get an auth token from Spotify. Head over to https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-current-user-top-artists-and-tracks and click on 'Get Token'. Tick the boxes 'user-top-read' and 'user-read-recently-played' and request your token. You may have to first register an application with Spotify.
